**Python** is an [interpreted](/wiki/Interpreted_language "Interpreted language"), [high-level](/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language"), [general-purpose](/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language "General-purpose programming language") [programming language](/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"). Created by [Guido van Rossum](/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum "Guido van Rossum") and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes [code readability](/wiki/Code_readability "Code readability") with its notable use of [significant whitespace](/wiki/Off-side_rule "Off-side rule"). Its [language constructs](/wiki/Language_construct "Language construct") and [object-oriented](/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") approach aim to help [programmers](/wiki/Programmers "Programmers") write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<sup id="cite_ref-AutoNT-7_28-0" class="reference">[[28]](#cite_note-AutoNT-7-28)</sup>

Python is [dynamically typed](/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language "Dynamic programming language") and [garbage-collected](/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "Garbage collection (computer science)"). It supports multiple [programming paradigms](/wiki/Programming_paradigms "Programming paradigms"), including [structured](/wiki/Structured_programming "Structured programming") (particularly, [procedural](/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming")), [object-oriented](/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming"), and [functional programming](/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming"). Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive [standard library](/wiki/Standard_library "Standard library").<sup id="cite_ref-About_29-0" class="reference">[[29]](#cite_note-About-29)</sup>

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the [ABC language](/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) "ABC (programming language)"). Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like [list comprehensions](/wiki/List_comprehension "List comprehension") and a garbage collection system with [reference counting](/wiki/Reference_counting "Reference counting").

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely [backward-compatible](/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility"), and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">[[30]](#cite_note-30)</sup> No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">[[31]](#cite_note-31)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">[[32]](#cite_note-32)</sup> With Python 2's [end-of-life](/wiki/End-of-life_(product) "End-of-life (product)"), only Python 3.5.x<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">[[33]](#cite_note-33)</sup> and later are supported.

Python [interpreters](/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) "Interpreter (computing)") are available for many [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). A global community of programmers develops and maintains [CPython](/wiki/CPython "CPython"), a [free and open-source](/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software")<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">[[34]](#cite_note-34)</sup> [reference implementation](/wiki/Reference_implementation "Reference implementation"). A non-profit organization, the [Python Software Foundation](/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation "Python Software Foundation"), manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
